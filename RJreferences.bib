Renjin is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and R code.
Renjin's development is primarily supported by BeDataDriven, but ultimately made possible by several current and past contributors including Mehmet Hakan Satman,
Hannes MÃ¼hleisen, and Ruslan Shevchenko.},
