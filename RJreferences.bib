Hannes MÃ¼hleisen, and Ruslan Shevchenko.},

	abstract = {GraalVM is a Java VM and JDK based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, implemented in Java. It supports additional programming languages and execution modes, like ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications for fast startup and low memory footprint. The first production-ready version, GraalVM 19.0, was released in May 2019.
Major differentiators of GraalVM compared to the base JDK are:

GraalVM Compiler, a JIT compiler for Java
GraalVM Native Image, allowing the ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications
Truffle Language Implementation framework and the GraalVM SDK, to implement additional programming language runtimes
LLVM Runtime and JavaScript Runtime},
